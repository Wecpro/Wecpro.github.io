                <h2 id="Beginnings，Dreams，and-Future"><a href="#Beginnings，Dreams，and-Future" class="headerlink" title="Beginnings，Dreams，and Future"></a><strong>Beginnings，Dreams，and Future</strong></h2><p>The Lumin Lumio online education platform is a volunteer education team composed of young people with an average age of 18, dedicated to improving rural information poverty and helping to build an “information civilized family.” Thereby helping to improve educational inequities.</p>
<p>Information poverty alleviation is a special poverty alleviation method to solve the information poverty of the information poor and the economic poverty caused by it by means of the promotion of information technology and the development of information activities. We hope to use information technology to help rural people better understand the importance of education, and at the same time provide them with better quality education resources, help them build information-civilized families, improve their comprehensive literacy, and improve education poverty.</p>
<p>The importance of building a civilized family is because the family is the foundation during a person’s growth. A person and his original family are inextricably linked, and this connection may last a lifetime. According to the research of psychologist Maslow, when a person’s physiological needs are met, the greatest desire in the heart is love and a sense of belonging. Children’s greatest desire is the sense of belonging connected with their parents, that is, to do the same thing as their parents. By doing the same thing, the child can feel that “we are together”. This is the need for a sense of belonging. From this we can see that the construction of a family learning atmosphere is of great significance to a child’s life, and it is also of great significance to the cultivation of his learning habits and interests.</p>
<p>However, due to the uneven distribution of resources, rural people have less access to information than urban people, resulting in a greatly reduced ability and opportunity for rural people to obtain information in informatization. This inequality of information has led to a small occupation of potential educational resources in rural areas, inadequate quality and insufficient attention from families. However, as the country’s emphasis on rural education in recent years has been accompanied by the promulgation of a series of policies, the level of education and the popularity of education have greatly increased. However, many families and their students still lack the awareness of the importance of education, and they often use electronic products to do things that are not related to learning (such as reading novels instead of using mobile phones to search for information / reading novels instead of using mobile phones to go online instead of learning. Yinkuaishou) Therefore, the initiative to establish an information-civilized family is of great significance.</p>
<p>Wanting to change something is not just waiting to ride the train of the times, the individual itself can or should be the fuel for this train. Before realizing this, my voluntary teaching and research had already begun. Perhaps it is precisely because it is being practiced that the answer will be reached.</p>
<p>We have all heard words like “everyone has many possibilities in the future”, and we have all thought about our own bright future. It is everyone’s right to imagine a beautiful tomorrow, but the world is not only beautiful. Because beauty sometimes seems far away, the reason is sometimes family background, sometimes opportunity, and sometimes personal effort.</p>
<p>In some voluntary teaching activities and research, we have seen some children dare not imagine their tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is exactly why we founded Luming Lumio: education has the power to put imagination into practice.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we guard the children’s “dare to think”; on the other hand, we put the new education in our imagination into time.</p>
<p>The future development of education may just need me, just need us to increase the salary. We can do neither more nor less, within the scope of our ability, organize a group of like-minded partners to go into education and help others. A teacher can lead a student well is an achievement. No matter what kind of group we are facing, we all want to protect the children’s imagination of tomorrow and help them to grasp the confidence that “I am worthy of beauty”.</p>
<p>Our project is Lumen in Chinese, Lumio in English, and Lumen is the unit of light flux. Lumio refers to light.</p>
<p>The knowledge we transmit is itself a shining light. We are also light, because we are passing light (knowledge).</p>
<p>Just flowing, knowledge will change, and people will change. Some people may not have been in this project for that long, but this project will continue and the light will continue to advance.</p>
<p>Lumen homophonic stays bright, keep tomorrow. We keep our beautiful tomorrow in this project, and we hope to keep the children’s beautiful tomorrow.</p>
<p>I hope that the Lumin Lumio online education platform is not only a channel to transfer knowledge, but also a base for us to put the new education we imagined into practice.</p>
<p>Each of us is a shining star, and we hope that this platform is the sky that carries many stars.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<strong>Lumio Education Team 2020</strong></p>

We believe a liberal arts education is a pragmatic choice today-liberal arts education having practical value. <br> 
We believe one learns best when interacting with people of different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives.  <br> 
We believe education really sparks one's intellectual interest and curiosity, and compels one to explore more in the program/area of study that one indicated.
