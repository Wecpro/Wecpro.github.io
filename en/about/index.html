                <h2 id="Beginnings，Dreams，and-Future"><a href="#Beginnings，Dreams，and-Future" class="headerlink" title="Beginnings，Dreams，and Future"></a><strong>Beginnings，Dreams，and Future</strong></h2><p>The Lumin Lumio online education platform is a volunteer education team composed of young adolescents with an average age of 18, dedicated to improving the lack of educational resources in rural regions of China and helping to build more “informationalized family.” Thereby seeking to improve educational inequality.</p>
<p>To futher improve the level of informationization for the poverty family, we use methods such the promotion of information technology and the development of information activities to overcome their financial dilemmas. We want to take advantage of technology to help the poverty regions better understand the importance of education, and meanwhile provide them with different high qality education resources. We hope this practice will improve the overall literacy for the rural famiy as well as their educational poverty.</p>
<p>It is important to building an information-civilized family, because family is the foundation during a person’s growth. A person and his family of origin are inextricably connected, and this connection may last a lifetime. According to the research of psychologist Maslow, when a person’s physiological needs are met, the greatest desire of the person will switch to spiritual needs such as love and a sense of belonging.For instance, a child’s greatest desire is the sense of belonging built through the connection with parents, that is, to do the same thing with their parents. By doing the same thing, the child can gain the feeling of “we are together”. Such is the person’s demand for a sense of belonging. From this we can see that constructing a family learning atmosphere is of great significance to a child’s life, and will also profoundly impact the the child’s learning habits and interests.</p>
<p>However, due to the uneven distribution of resources, rural families have less access to information than urban families, resulting in a greatly reduced ability and opportunity for rural families to obtain valuable information through informationization. This lack of information transmission has led to a minimal occupation of potential educational resources in rural areas, and this problem dives almost little to none attention from the rural families. However, as the country started to emphasis more on rural education in recent years, the overall literacy and educational penetration has been vastly improved by the promulgation of a series of government policies, the level of education and the popularity of education have greatly increased. Nonethless, many families and students still lack the awareness of the importance of education, and they often use technology to do things that are not related to learning but rather on entertainment (EX: reading novels, spending times on social medias such as Tiktok, games, etc.) Therefore, the initiative to establish an information-civilized family is of great significance.</p>
<p>To successfuly enforce changes, it is not only important for the individual to ride on the right train, but he/she should also be the fuel for this train. Before even realizing this, our voluntary teaching and research had already begun. Perhaps it was these practical experience that inspired us to found Lumio EDU.</p>
<p>We have all heard words like “everyone has infinite possibilities in life”, and we have all thought about our own bright future. It is everyone’s right to imagine a bright future, but the reality is not always ideal. A lot of times we need to pay persistant effort to reach that future, due to the different family background, opportunity, and resource we have.</p>
<p>In some voluntary teaching activities and research, we have seen some children scared to dream about their future.</p>
<p>This is exactly why we founded Lumio: education has the power to put imagination into practice.</p>
<p>On one hand, we guard the children’s “courage to think”; on the other hand, we turn our desired form of education into real practice and dedicate ourselves with it.</p>
<p>we might be the leaders for the future development of education, we will be the ones who starts this “new age of Education”. We can do neither too much nor too less, but just within the scope of our ability, organize a group of people who have the same beliefs and dreams to spread education to those who need. Even one teacher who can inspire a single student is considered a phenominal achievement. No matter what kind of audience we are facing, we will always promote the best of our abilities to protect the children’s bright future and help them to grasp the confidence that “I deserve all the wonderful things in this world”.</p>
<p>Our project is Lumen in Chinese, Lumio in English, and Lumen is the unit of light flux. Lumio refers to light.</p>
<p>The knowledge we transmit is a shining light itself. We make up this light, because we are spreading light (knowledge) through this platform.</p>
<p>Just as light flows, knowledge will change as time passes. So do people. Some people may not have been in this project for that long, but this project will continue in the future and the light will continue to progress.</p>
<p>In chinese, the pronounciation of Lumio is liuming, which has the meaning of keeping future. We keep our future in this project, and we hope to keep the children’s future in this project as well.</p>
<p>We hope that the Lumio online education platform is not only a channel to transfer knowledge, but also a fundation for us to put the form of education we desired into practice.</p>
<p>Each of us is a star, and we hope that this platform is the sky that makes you shine.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;<strong>Lumio Education Team 2020</strong></p>

We believe a liberal arts education is a pragmatic choice today-liberal arts education having practical value. <br> 
We believe one learns best when interacting with people of different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives.  <br> 
We believe education really sparks one's intellectual interest and curiosity, and compels one to explore more in the program/area of study that one indicated.
